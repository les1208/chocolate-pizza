	<p id="texttwo">For the fig-swirl: Melt butter over medium heat in a saucepan. Add brown sugar and stir it to
		dissolve. Halve all of the figs and toss in the saucepan with water and lemon juice. Cook over medium heat, stirring
		frequently, until you have a chunky-jammy mixture. Add salt with one or two stirs, set aside and let cool
		completely. </p>
	<p id="textthree">Ice cream: In a small pot over medium heat, combine milk, and granulated sugar until sugar is
		completely dissolved and the milk is barely lukewarm. Whisk in the egg yolks. Set mixture in the fridge and wait
		until fig mixture is cooled.</p>
	<p id="textfour">Using an ice cream machine, pour liquids into the frozen basin and process according to manufacturer
		instructions, i.e., let spin and thicken for 20 minutes before adding mascarpone, fig jam mixture and the nuts.
		Continue to process for +/- 10 minutes. Pour semi-frozen mixture into a pyrex dish or glass tupperware. Freeze for
		at least two hours before serving.</p>
